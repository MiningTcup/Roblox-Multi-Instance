## Instructions
[**Video Tutorial**](https://youtu.be/052rSExTrZY)
1. Open the program
2. Make sure to close all instances of Roblox
3. Press any key
4. You can now open as many Roblox instances as you want on the same device, granted they are on separate accounts.

***

## How it works
```c#
new Mutex(true, "ROBLOX_singletonMutex");
```
Basically, this line of code takes control of the part of Roblox that says "No multi-instance for you!" and disables it.
You can see the whole thing in [Program.cs](https://github.com/MiningTcup/Roblox-Multi-Instance/blob/main/Program.cs).

## More
Q. Why does my antivirus ding it?


A. Because it uses a mutex, which could be malicious.


Q. Will I get banned from Roblox?


A. Extremely unlikely, as this is not against Roblox ToS and the exploit is undetectable anyway. However, I cannot guarantee anything, and, as Roblox is banning alt accounts, try not to be too suspicious.
